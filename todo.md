| ----- | --- | -- | -- | -- |
| [TickTick](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/00Eci0pqG2SVLDs8vlNv0s4-15.fit_lim.size_1050x.png) | ✔ Good | ❌ No | ✔ Good | Ideal for ToDo tasks. Great for notifications!
| [TwosApp](https://i.imgur.com/HBBUK93.png) | ➖ Sometimes skipped | ✔ Yes | ➖ Normal | Combine application for task management 
| [Todoist](https://dl.flathub.org/repo/screenshots/com.todoist.Todoist-stable/1248x702/com.todoist.Todoist-1b2c0318c8519755e25f4df8ebd923a3.png) | ❌ No | ✔ Yes (google) | ✔ Good | Suitable for a quick capture, but simple on its own
| [Any.do](https://www.any.do/v5/images/teams/my-team.webp) | ❌ No | ✔ Yes | ❌ Slowly | Handy for managing "calendar" tasks, block time, schedule and planing

As you can see in **my usage scenario** **TickTick** wins. The app has free and dynamic management of repetitive tasks and also has constant reminders that are always triggered on the phone and never missed (e.g. on the aggressive EMUI shell). 

**TwosApp** looks interesting, but it feels cluttered. Reminders also sometimes don't work on aggressive android shells.

It will be good for scheduling a lot of deadlines, such as studying.
